Welcome to the current front page for Runic Arcana.

Runic Arcana is an up and coming mod centered around meaningful magical problem solving and design.  It is centered around custom, player defined enchantments for any given item or tool, and will expand on this to other area of magic, such as potion making, infusions, and sorcery.

Runic Arcana is licensed under the MIT license.  It is currently open-source, but may potentially close to ensure an element of mystery and problem solving for its players.
